# webScraper
This is a web scraper / automation script to submit data to an endpoint on freetutorialsus.com

The scraper was built with Javascript alongside third party modules like cheerios and axios

Here are a list of links that got my foot wet with web scraping 

This was my entry point into web scraping 
https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/introduction-to-web-scraping-with-nodejs-9h2

Used this to pick up on how to send request using axios
https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-make-http-requests-like-a-pro-with-axios/

This helped me understand how to grab tags, their values and a load of other attributes from html elements
https://cheerio.js.org/.
